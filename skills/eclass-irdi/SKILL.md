description: ECLASS / IEC CDD IRDI grammar and IDTA conventions — the transversal reference card for every semanticId that starts with digits instead of https. Covers IRDI anatomy per ISO/IEC 11179-6 / ISO 29002-5 (RAI#DI#VI, the 01/02/05/07 code-type prefixes, the `#00Z` version suffix), the IEC CDD slash form (0112/2///61360_4#…), how to tell IRDI from IRI, the IDTA primary-vs-supplemental pairing conventions (IEC CDD primary + ECLASS supplemental vs ECLASS-as-primary), version-suffix drift between template revisions, ECLASS Release re-keying (all DIs change, not just versions), printed-PDF anomalies (the '~0' infix, cdp-URL-only rows), the eclass-cdp '#'→'-' URL convention, the URL-encoding trap (# → %23), where to verify an IRDI (cdp.eclass-cdp.com / cdd.iec.ch), the frozen-map discipline, and the ECLASS licensing boundary. Use this skill whenever the user works with an IRDI, mentions ECLASS or IEC CDD, pastes a 0173-1#… or 0112/2///61360… identifier, asks "is this semanticId an IRDI or an IRI", wires ConceptDescription dictionary entries, debugs a supplementalSemanticId, migrates a template across ECLASS Releases (re-keying), or touches lib/eclass/irdi.ts / irdi-catalog.ts / response-parser.ts IRDI handling. This skill carries NO bundled PDF and NO frozen map — its ground truth is ISO 11179-6/29002-5 grammar, the verbatim evidence frozen in the sibling skills' maps (aas-nameplate, aas-handover), and the live registries. It deliberately does NOT reproduce ECLASS dictionary content (licensed).

# ECLASS / IEC CDD IRDI — grammar, conventions, pitfalls

The transversal reference for **IRDIs** (International Registration Data
Identifiers) as they appear in AAS/IDTA work: what the string means, how IDTA
templates deploy them, and the bug classes they breed. Unlike the per-template
skills, there is **no bundled PDF and no frozen map here** — nothing to freeze.
Ground truth is (a) ISO/IEC 11179-6 / ISO 29002-5 grammar, (b) verbatim
evidence already frozen in [[aas-nameplate]] `semanticid-map-3-0-1.json` and
[[aas-handover]] `semanticid-map-2-0.json`, (c) the live registries
(cdp.eclass-cdp.com, cdd.iec.ch). **This skill must never grow a copy of the
ECLASS dictionary** — grammar and conventions only (see Licensing).

Companion to [[iec61360]] (the ConceptDescription/data-spec side),
[[aas-nameplate]] / [[aas-handover]] (the two frozen evidence bases),
[[aas-submodel-templates]] (which template uses which id style), and
[[aas-knowledge]].

## 1. IRDI anatomy — `RAI#DI#VI`

An IRDI is three `#`-separated parts (ISO/IEC 11179-6; resolution per ISO
29002-5): **Registration Authority Identifier # Data Identifier # Version**.

```
0173-1#02-AAO677#002
└─┬──┘ └───┬───┘ └┬─┘
  RAI      DI     VI
```

- **RAI** `0173-1` — ICD `0173` (ISO 6523 code for ECLASS) + organization part
  `1`. Every ECLASS IRDI starts `0173-1`.
- **DI** `02-AAO677` — a 2-digit **code-type prefix** + `-` + the **6-char
  data identifier** (uppercase letters/digits). The prefix tells you WHAT is
  identified:
  | prefix | identifies | example (verbatim from the frozen maps) |
  |---|---|---|
  | `01-` | classification class | `0173-1#01-AHF578#003` (HandoverDocumentation submodel) |
  | `02-` | property | `0173-1#02-AAO677#004` (ManufacturerName) |
  | `05-` | unit | (units of measure — see [[iec61360]] unitId) |
  | `07-` | value / enumeration entry | `0173-1#07-ABU490#003` (VDI 2770 class "03-02 Operation"); CE marking value `0173-1#07-DAA603#004` |
- **VI** `#002` — 3-digit version suffix. **The same DI with a different VI is
  a different revision of the same concept** — and templates DO bump it (see
  version-suffix drift below).

**IEC CDD form** (ICD `0112`, slash-separated RAI):
`0112/2///61360_4#AAA000#001` — `0112` = IEC, `/2` = CDD, `///` empty
sub-fields, then the source database (`61360_4`, `61987`, `61360_7` in the
Nameplate map) before the usual `#DI#VI`. Real examples:
`0112/2///61987#ABA565#009` (ManufacturerName primary),
`0112/2///61360_7#AAS006#001` (Markings SML primary).

**ECLASS pair form** — IDTA prints SMC/SML semanticIds as a property-IRDI +
class-IRDI joined by `/`:
`0173-1#02-ABI500#003/0173-1#01-AHF579#003` (Document SMC). And sometimes the
class IRDI ALONE: `0173-1#01-AHD205#004` (GuidelineSpecificProperties__00__ —
deliberately different from its containing SML's pair). The pair is ONE
semanticId string; do not split it into two keys.

**IRDI vs IRI — the 2-second test:** starts with `https://` or `urn:` → IRI.
Starts with digits and contains `#` → IRDI (`/` inside digits = IEC CDD slash
form, still not an IRI — no scheme). Both are legal `GlobalReference` values;
neither is "wrong" per se — which one is REQUIRED depends on the template (§2).

**URL-encoding trap:** `#` is the URI fragment delimiter. An IRDI pasted raw
into a query param silently truncates at the first `#` — always encode
(`#`→`%23`): `?semanticId=0173-1%2302-AAO677%23002`. ECLASS CDP deep links
avoid the problem by substitution: the printed supplementals use
`https://api.eclass-cdp.com/<IRDI with '#'→'-'>`, e.g. `0173-1#02-ABI501#003`
→ `https://api.eclass-cdp.com/0173-1-02-ABI501-003`. That `-` form is a URL
convention, NOT an alternative IRDI spelling — never store it as the IRDI.

## 2. THE IDTA CONVENTIONS (the load-bearing part)

### Primary vs supplemental — two patterns, check the PDF's two-row layout

- **Newer templates (Nameplate 3.0.1 pattern):** IEC CDD IRDI is the PRIMARY
  semanticId, ECLASS IRDI is the SUPPLEMENTAL. Verbatim:
  ManufacturerName primary `0112/2///61987#ABA565#009`, supplemental
  `0173-1#02-AAO677#004`; URIOfTheProduct primary `0112/2///61987#ABN590#002`,
  supplemental `0173-1#02-ABH173#003`.
- **Older/other templates (Handover 2.0 pattern):** ECLASS IRDI IS the
  primary — the submodel semanticId itself is `0173-1#01-AHF578#003`, and the
  printed supplemental is the eclass-cdp URL
  (`https://api.eclass-cdp.com/0173-1-02-ABI500-003` for Documents).
- **The trap:** a single ECLASS IRDI in a template table is often the
  SUPPLEMENTAL when an IEC CDD primary exists — the PDF prints them as two
  rows per element. A parser/template that emits the ECLASS IRDI as the
  primary of a Nameplate-3.0 element has flipped the pair (AAS Studio's
  `response-parser.ts:548` does exactly this, by admission in its own
  comment). Exceptions exist WITHIN one template: Nameplate 3.0.1's
  AssetSpecificProperties has NO IEC CDD primary — the ECLASS pair IS the
  primary. Per-element, not per-template — read the row.

### Version-suffix drift (same DI, bumped #00Z)

Template revisions bump the VI while the DI stays put:
`0173-1#02-AAO677#002` (Nameplate 2.0) → `#004` (3.0.1);
`0173-1#02-AAM985#002` → `#004`. **Real bug:** FirmwareVersion — the app
parser carried `0173-1#02-AAM985#003` while the 3.0.1 template says `#004`
(the parser lagged the template; 3.0.1 bug fix #123 territory). A VI mismatch
is silent: nothing crashes, cross-document matching just stops working.

### Release re-keying (ALL DIs change — not versions)

ECLASS Releases can re-key EVERY IRDI of a template revision. Handover
v2.0 moved to **ECLASS Release 15, non-backward compatible with 1.2 (Annex C
change #2)** — every DI changed, not just VIs: 1.2-era
`0173-1#02-AAY813#001` (Language) / `0173-1#02-AAY814#001` (DocumentVersionId)
vs 2.0 `0173-1#02-AAN468#008` (Language) / `0173-1#02-AAP003#005` (Version).
**Never assume an old IRDI is "the same concept, older version"** — a
different DI is a different dictionary entry; bumping the VI of an old DI
fabricates an identifier. Migration = re-key every element from the new PDF.

### Printing anomalies in official PDFs — copy VERBATIM + warn, never "fix"

Frozen, binary-verified examples from the sibling maps:
- **The `~0` infix** — Handover's Document supplemental prints
  `0173-1#02-ABI500#003~0/0173-1#01-AHF579#003` (PDF p.10, verified in the
  binary). Not valid IRDI grammar; copied verbatim into the map with a
  warning.
- **cdp-URL-only row** — OrganizationShortName prints ONLY
  `https://api.eclass-cdp.com/0173-1-02-ABI002-003` — no IRDI at all (every
  sibling prints both). The pattern-expected IRDI `0173-1#02-ABI002#003` is
  recorded as a GUESS pending the official AASX, not as fact.
- **Line-break hyphen loss** — Nameplate prints `0173-1#02AAM985#004`
  (hyphen eaten at a line break); normalized WITH a note in the map.
- **Duplicate-concept smell** — SoftwareVersion's supplemental prints
  IDENTICAL to FirmwareVersion's (`AAM985#004`; expected lineage `AAM737`).
  Copied verbatim + flagged VERIFY.

The rule: the map records what the PDF PRINTS. Anomalies get a `warnings`
entry and a VERIFY flag against the official template AASX — hand-"fixing" an
anomaly invents an identifier that exists nowhere.

## 3. Verification workflow

**Where to check an IRDI** (do not trust memory — including this skill's):
- **ECLASS:** public search at `https://cdp.eclass-cdp.com` (ECLASS
  ContentDevelopmentPlatform); the per-IRDI deep link is the `#`→`-` form
  under `api.eclass-cdp.com` (§1). Note WHICH Release you are reading.
- **IEC CDD:** `https://cdd.iec.ch` (free browsing of IEC 61360-4/61987/…
  databases).
- **The template itself:** the LIVE official IDTA PDF + its published AASX —
  for template work these outrank both registries, because the template
  fixes the exact VI (and carries the anomalies).

**Frozen-map discipline** (how the sibling skills kill this bug class): skill
extracts every semanticId VERBATIM from the official IDTA PDF → frozen JSON
map next to the SKILL.md → copied byte-identical into the app → **no
hand-typed IRIs/IRDIs anywhere in code**. Every anomaly is a `warnings` entry,
every unprintable value a `VERIFY-IN-PDF` marker. A new template skill that
hand-types its table has already failed.

**AAS Studio guardrails:**
- `parser-irdi-consistency.test.ts` — guards that no field emits an IRDI
  conflicting with the template (`lib/ai/irdi-catalog.ts:756` cites it).
- **Catalogue bug class #16: the template being right does NOT save the
  parser.** `lib/templates/nameplate.ts` and `lib/ai/response-parser.ts` emit
  independently — both must be verified (the FirmwareVersion `#003` vs `#004`
  lag lived exactly in that gap; the parser's flat-handover block at
  `response-parser.ts:669-672` still emits wrong-CONCEPT IRDIs:
  Title→`0173-1#02-AAU731#003` = Nameplate ManufacturerProductFamily).
- `lib/ai/irdi-catalog.ts` curation policy (header, verbatim spirit): only
  verifiable entries; when uncertain leave the IRDI OFF — "a missing IRDI is
  a known gap; a wrong IRDI corrupts every downstream consumer".

## 4. KNOWN NOTES — `lib/eclass/irdi.ts` contract + gaps (do not edit blind)

The app's IRDI module (`/Users/miguel.reis/Desktop/AAS-Studio-Fable/lib/eclass/irdi.ts`):
`IRDI_PATTERN` (`/^\d{4}-\d+#[A-Za-z0-9]{2}-[A-Za-z0-9]{4,8}#\d{3}$/`),
`isValidIrdi` (trim + test), `looksLikeIrdiAttempt` (heuristic: IRIs and
anything with `/` are NEVER IRDI attempts — deliberate, fixes the old
"admin-shell" false-flag), `formatIrdi` (trim only), `parseIrdiParts`.

Gaps spotted (documented, NOT fixed — flag before relying):
1. **IEC CDD slash form is unvalidatable** — `0112/2///61360_4#AAA000#001`
   contains `/`, so `isValidIrdi` rejects it and `looksLikeIrdiAttempt`
   waves it through as "not an IRDI attempt". There is no validator at all
   for the form used by every Nameplate-3.0 PRIMARY.
2. **ECLASS pair form rejected** — `0173-1#02-ABI219#003/0173-1#01-AHD205#004`
   (printed as ONE semanticId for SMCs/SMLs) fails `isValidIrdi` for the same
   `/` reason. Pairs pass through unchecked.
3. **`parseIrdiParts` is stricter than `IRDI_PATTERN`** — it requires exactly
   6 DI chars (`{6}`) where the pattern allows `{4,8}`; a value that passes
   `isValidIrdi` can still return `null` from `parseIrdiParts`.
4. **Mislabeled parts** — `parseIrdiParts` returns the ECLASS org part (`1`
   of `0173-1`) as `vi` and the ACTUAL version suffix as `dt`; `di` includes
   the code-type prefix. Anyone consuming `.vi` expecting ISO 11179's
   Version Identifier gets the wrong field.
5. **Lenient casing / no normalization** — pattern accepts lowercase DIs
   (ECLASS prints uppercase); `formatIrdi` won't repair known paste damage
   (`%23`, PDF hyphen loss) nor reject the `~0` anomaly.

## 5. Licensing — the boundary

**ECLASS dictionary content is licensed.** The line this repo holds:
- ✔ Carrying IRDI strings that appear VERBATIM in public IDTA template PDFs,
  citing the template as source (that is what the frozen maps do — their
  `source` field names the PDF and tables).
- ✔ Naming grammar, code-type prefixes, Release mechanics, and where to look
  things up.
- ✘ Bundling, scraping, or reproducing the ECLASS dictionary itself —
  preferredNames/definitions/units en masse, class trees, or "the ECLASS
  properties for class X" dumps. A lookup NEED is answered with a CDP/CDD
  pointer, not a copy. (Same policy in `irdi-catalog.ts`: small, curated,
  per-entry citations — not a mirrored dictionary.)

## 6. Sign-off checklist (before shipping anything IRDI-touching)

1. **IRDI or IRI?** Scheme prefix → IRI; digits+`#` → IRDI; `0112/2///` →
   IEC CDD IRDI (don't let a `/` fool a validator — see KNOWN NOTES).
2. **Primary or supplemental?** Checked the template PDF's two-row layout for
   THIS element — not assumed from the template's general pattern?
3. **Which ECLASS Release?** Same-DI-different-VI = revision; different DI =
   re-keyed Release or different concept. No fabricated "older versions".
4. **VI matches the LIVE template PDF?** (FirmwareVersion `#003`-vs-`#004`
   class of lag.)
5. **Parser AND template both updated?** (bug class #16 — verify both
   emitters + `parser-irdi-consistency` green.)
6. **Anomalies copied verbatim with a warning**, VERIFY-flagged against the
   official AASX — nothing hand-"fixed"?
7. **Pair form kept as ONE string**; cdp `-` URL never stored as the IRDI;
   `#` encoded as `%23` in any query param.
8. **No ECLASS dictionary content** copied beyond what the cited IDTA PDF
   prints.
